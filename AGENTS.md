# AgentDock development rules

This repository is the user's extension fork. Keep changes on the current feature
branch. Never publish to the upstream author's repository.

## Before editing

1. Load `agentdock_context` for this working tree. Check Git status, the current
   task, and local rules. Read the complete files being changed.
2. Find the existing responsibility and tests. Make a bounded implementation plan
   before changing code. Do not create parallel runtimes, task systems or themes.
3. Preserve unrelated changes. Do not reset, stash or overwrite another agent's work.

## Implementation boundaries

- `Runtime.Call` / `callObserved` owns external tool admission and root call identity.
  Children inherit an immutable binding. Never infer a conversation from the latest
  task, selected window or account. Unattributed calls stay unattributed.
- Tool RPCs, internal spans and command processes have separate lifetimes. Count
  only roots in totals. Unknown timings and outcomes are nullable, never fake zero
  or success. Use monotonic durations inside a process.
- Persist redacted facts before presenting them. Keep parameters, diff previews,
  output, caches, queues and subscriptions bounded. Never recursively observe
  journal writes, UI queries, heartbeats or background probes as AI requests.
- Views render state; services own I/O and cancellation. Bind selected, checked and
  expanded states explicitly. Hover or keyboard focus is not business state.
- Theme colors, borders and sizing belong in shared resources. Do not set hardcoded
  brushes in event handlers. Keep default and focused control geometry identical.
- All I/O must have cancellation, errors and resource cleanup. Do not synchronously
  block the UI with `.Wait()` / `.Result`; use `async void` only for event handlers.
- Keep one canonical implementation. Name files and types by responsibility, not
  New, Final or V2. Put necessary old-data conversion at a documented boundary.
- Keep authentication, permission checks, installation rollback and configuration
  ownership intact. A display setting must never restart the running core.

## Verification and delivery

Run Go formatting/tests and Windows desktop tests. Add regression tests for each
changed behavior; do not remove tests or weaken assertions to obtain a green build.
Use injected time for activity boundaries. Verify concurrent conversations, calls
without tasks, old records, rejected writes and asynchronous command completion.

Fork state map: `docs/eerraa/fork-map.ko.md` (identity, fork delta owners and
invariants, upstream merge checklist, verification commands, local build). Update
it with every fork change; keep history in Git, not in documents. The source
baseline is the Workbench v1.1.8 prerelease tag
`4bd778d4077bbe58cfe19e4abb777f660694377b`. Keep only pinned rg, Korean
presentation, the CUA desktop plugin (`plugins/cua-driver`) and
reproducer-proven minimal fixes at the existing owners. Do not reintroduce
composite hosts, Origin pipes, epochs or parallel state systems.

This fork is updated only by running a new Setup. The tray/window update entry
opens the fork Releases page, and `agentdock update` refuses online checks and
downloads; only the maintenance `--local-archive` path remains. Do not re-enable
the online updater or publish updater archives as a user update path.

Work on a `fix|feat|docs/<topic>` branch in the main working tree, verify, then
fast-forward or merge main and push only to origin (`eerraa/AgentDock-Workbench`).
Never push upstream, force push, rewrite shared history, move public tags,
overwrite released bytes or change open PR heads. Build or publish a release only
when the user asks, from a clean clone as described in the map.

Never run Setup or install/upgrade/uninstall/recover the operational PC. Never
replace/restart production Core or change production Cloudflare/Tailscale or
credentials. Real installer acceptance requires a genuine isolated Windows runner
or disposable VM; do not impersonate one through environment variables. Local
explicit disposable unit/native fixtures are allowed. Preserve runner-only test
guards and distinguish a local build from an unexecuted runner test.

Versions follow `1.1.<upstream patch>100` (now 1.1.8100). Never reuse a published
fork version (1.1.6100, 1.1.16101, 1.1.16102, 1.1.17100) for new bytes. Source,
tests, packaging, installation, publication and actual asset redownload are
separate delivery states; report each honestly, including Korean and rg content
in the actual payload, source identity, checksums, signing status and every step
that was not run.

Preserve failed tests and blocked-request messages. Do not retry an explicit safety or
permission denial through another tool, encoding or argument decomposition; only
independent permitted work may continue.
Keep the 120s activity, 180s request eligibility and 300s insertion expiry separate.
